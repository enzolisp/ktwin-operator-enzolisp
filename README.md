# KTWIN - Kubernetes-based Platform for Digital Twins

KTWIN Operator manages the creation of KTWIN resources within the Kubernetes cluster.

## Description

KTWIN is a Digital Twin platform built on top of Kubernetes and powered by Knative Serverless workloads. KTWIN uses Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to extend Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL), providing more control and flexibility over the underlying container-based services that compose the the DT landscape and reduction of operational costs by automating manual operations.

## Getting Started

You’ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=ghcr.io/open-digital-twin/ktwin-operator:0.1
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=ghcr.io/open-digital-twin/ktwin-operator@sha256:d17285f3e2852023c0dc0d0389615ea96e81ed594d2de8fa480ca178ca2a7b08
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
